>  Longitudinal data were used from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 853 women and 930 men aged 60–96 years were recruited. Latent class and latent transition analysis (LCA/LTA) were used to identify meaningful subgroups, transitions between those classes across time, and baseline demographic features that help to predict and design tailored interventions.
> <br>
>  Three depression subgroups were identified: Class 1 was labeled “Mild Depression”; Class 2 was labeled “Severe Depression” and class 3 was labeled “Lack of Positive Affect”. A predominant tendency for stability appeared rather than change, meanwhile individual in Mild Depression and Severe Depression latent status both had a high probability to convert to the Lack of Positive Affect latent status. Social activities played a significant role in buffering the effect of depression, while individuals with chronic diseases, having difficulty with ADLs and smoking might be at-risk groups.
