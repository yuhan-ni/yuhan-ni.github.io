title: "The need to belong: A parallel process latent growth curve model of late life negative affect and cognitive function"

excerpt: 'A parallel process latent growth curve model with two time-invariant covariates and seven time-varying covariates was used to demonstrate the joint trajectories of NA and CF to assess their related factors in the elderly during a 12-year period.Significant association of negative affect and cognitive decline was found at baseline and over time for our sample. Poorer initial cognitive performance predicted a faster increase in negative affect over time. Being female was associated with worse initial performance and a faster rate of deterioration of NA and CF. Regular exercise, married status, social activities, and Mahjong playing were associated with slower rates of negative affect increase and cognitive decline.'
